    "Consider the following card game. There are $n \\le 21$ cards numbered $1,2,...,n$ that are well *shuffled*. You draw the cards one-by-one. You win the game if by drawing the $i$ th card, you actually see number $i$ on the card for $i=1,2,...,n$. To illustrate, you win if by drawing the 10th card, you see the card with the number 10 written on it.\n",
